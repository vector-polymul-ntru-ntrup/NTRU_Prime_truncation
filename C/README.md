# C Implementation

This folder contains a C implementation of the underlying transformation.

# Test for correctness
Type `make` to produce the binary `test`,
and run `test` to test the correctness of the polynomial multiplication.

## Sample outputs
```
polymul finished!
```

# Generating constants
Type `make gen` to produce the binary `gen`,
and run `gen` to test the correctness of the generation.

## Sample outputs
```
gen finished!
```
