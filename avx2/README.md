- `avx2`: AVX2 polynomial multiplier.
- `avx2_bench`: Benchmarking the AVX2 polynomial multiplier.
- `libsntrup761-20210608`: Benchmarking the full `sntrup761` scheme. The performance of batched key generation is reported in our paper.
- `supercop-20230530_new.tar.gz`: Benchmarking the full `sntrup761` scheme under the SUPERCOP framework. The performance numbers of encapsulation and decapsulation are reported in our paper.
